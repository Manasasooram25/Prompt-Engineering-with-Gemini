worked with a large language model called Gemini to design
effective prompts. These prompts will guide Gemini towards generating precise
task trees, outlining the steps needed to cook specific dishes.

Input:
● Dish name and preferred ingredients
● Available ingredients and utensils in the kitchen (including their states - e.g.,
chopped onions, clean pot)

Task:
To design at least three different prompting approaches that
incorporate several examples of task tree generation for cooking meals. This will
equip Gemini with the necessary knowledge to create accurate task trees for any
given dish. You should compare those approaches, figure out their pros and cons,
and report their performances.

Output:
Task trees for each dish in the cafeteria menu.

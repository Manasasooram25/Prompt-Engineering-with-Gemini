In a well-equipped kitchen, you are preparing a delicious meal.  I have access to the kitchen equipments mentioned in (kitchen.txt)

I can also access previously generated task trees for reference, such as the two examples provided:

Example 1: Simple Vegetable Soup

This example shows a task tree for preparing a simple vegetable soup:

Wash and chop vegetables (e.g., carrots, celery).
Peel and dice potatoes.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan.
Add vegetables and cook until tender.
Transfer cooked vegetables to a serving bowl.

Example 2: Baked Chicken

This example shows a task tree for baking chicken:

Marinate chicken in a mixture of soy sauce, ginger, and garlic for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Place chicken on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.
Serve chicken with roasted vegetables (optional).

Dish to Generate Task Tree:

For all the dishes (from input.json)

Following these examples, create a detailed task tree.  

The task tree should have three main components:

  1. Preparation: This section lists all the necessary steps to prepare the ingredients (e.g., chopping vegetables, boiling pasta).
  2. Cooking: This section details the cooking instructions (e.g., boiling water, mixing ingredients).
  3. Plating: This section describes the final assembly and presentation of the dish (e.g., transferring to a serving bowl).

Use the available ingredients (listed in input.json) and the provided kitchen equipment(listed in kitchen.txt) to create a comprehensive task tree for all the dishes (listed in input.json), Give the output in json format. The output json should have input,output nodes and motion nodes. I will give you an example on how to specify input,output nodes and motion node :
Example Task Tree for "Simple Fruit Smoothie":
Ingredients: apples, bananas
1. Input Nodes: whole apple, whole banana
2. Motion Node:
   a. Wash the apple and banana.
   b. Peel the banana.
   c. Slice the apple and banana.
3. Output Nodes: sliced apple, sliced banana
4. Motion Node: Blend the sliced apple and banana with 1 cup of water.
5. Output Nodes: Smoothie
and output the task tree in json format
and don't give anything except the json format code with input , ouput, motion and state nodes. Ensure the JSON object is in a correct format and can be converted to valid JSON.
